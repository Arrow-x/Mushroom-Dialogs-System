# Mushroom Dialog System
An initial implementation for dialog system for Godot 3.2 inspired by the open source add-on for Unity Fungus
Mushroom Uses Godot resources as the basis for the Data structure, for now I am using a custom build of godot that allow for exporting custom resources, but this sould be unnecessary when with the dialog editor is finsished
